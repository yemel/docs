# Auxiliary Contracts

## Overview

The Auxiliary Contracts repository contains specialized utility contracts for administrative operations and cleanup tasks within the Decentraland ecosystem. These contracts provide essential tools for contract management, token burning, and system maintenance.

## Core Contracts

### DecentralandBurner

**Purpose**: Administrative contract providing arbitrary call execution capabilities and MANA token burning functionality.

**Key Specifications**:
- Owner-controlled arbitrary contract calls with ETH forwarding
- Specialized MANA token burning functionality  
- Contract ownership verification utilities
- Generic proxy pattern for administrative operations
- Emergency response capabilities

**Core Functions**:
- `execute(target, value, data)`: Execute arbitrary call to any contract
- `burn(amount)`: Burn specified amount of MANA tokens
- `isContractOwner(contractAddress)`: Check if burner owns a contract
- `transferOwnership(newOwner)`: Transfer burner ownership

**Execute Function Details**:
```solidity
function execute(
    address target,     // Contract to call
    uint256 value,     // ETH to send
    bytes data         // Function call data
) external onlyOwner returns (bytes memory) {
    // Executes any function on any contract
    // Forwards ETH if specified
    // Returns function result
}
```

**Security Features**:
- Owner-only access control
- Return data validation
- Call success verification
- Event emission for audit trail
- No reentrancy vulnerabilities

**Use Cases**:
- Emergency contract administration
- Token recovery operations
- Contract upgrade procedures
- System maintenance tasks
- Administrative cleanups

### MarketplaceBurner

**Purpose**: Specialized burner contract combining MANA burning with marketplace administration capabilities.

**Key Specifications**:
- MANA token burning functionality
- Marketplace ownership management
- Fee configuration controls
- Emergency pause capabilities
- Combined administrative interface

**Core Functions**:
- `burn(amount)`: Burn MANA tokens held by contract
- `transferMarketplaceOwnership(marketplace, newOwner)`: Transfer marketplace control
- `setOwnerCutPerMillion(marketplace, cut)`: Configure marketplace fees
- `pause(marketplace)`: Emergency stop marketplace
- `unpause(marketplace)`: Resume marketplace operations

**Marketplace Management**:
```solidity
// Fee configuration (per million for precision)
function setOwnerCutPerMillion(
    address marketplace,
    uint256 ownerCutPerMillion  // e.g., 25000 = 2.5%
) external onlyOwner {
    IMarketplace(marketplace).setOwnerCutPerMillion(ownerCutPerMillion);
}
```

**Administrative Capabilities**:
- Update marketplace parameters
- Emergency marketplace control
- Fee structure adjustments
- Ownership transitions
- Token burning operations

**Integration Points**:
- Works with legacy marketplace contracts
- Compatible with marketplace V1 and V2
- Integrates with MANA token contract
- Supports multiple marketplace instances

### Nobody

**Purpose**: Minimalist self-destruct contract for address cleanup and contract removal.

**Key Specifications**:
- Single-function contract
- Self-destructs on call
- Sends remaining ETH to caller
- Minimal gas consumption
- Address recycling utility

**Core Function**:
```solidity
function die() external {
    selfdestruct(payable(msg.sender));
}
```

**Technical Details**:
- No storage variables
- No access control (anyone can call)
- Immediate execution
- Irreversible operation
- ETH recovery mechanism

**Use Cases**:
- Contract cleanup after migrations
- Address recycling for gas refunds
- Removing obsolete contracts
- ETH recovery from contracts
- Testing and development cleanup

**Warning**: 
- Self-destruct is irreversible
- Contract code and storage deleted
- Address can be reused after destruction
- ETH automatically transferred to caller

## Administrative Patterns

### Arbitrary Execution Pattern

**Purpose**: Enable flexible administrative operations without deploying specific functions.

**Implementation**:
```solidity
// Example: Recovering stuck tokens
bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature(
    "transfer(address,uint256)",
    recipient,
    amount
);
burner.execute(tokenContract, 0, data);
```

**Benefits**:
- No need for specialized recovery functions
- Handles any contract interaction
- Reduces contract deployment needs
- Flexible emergency response
- Future-proof administration

### Token Burning Mechanism

**Purpose**: Permanent token supply reduction for economic management.

**MANA Burning Process**:
1. **Accumulation**: MANA collected in burner contract
2. **Authorization**: Owner decides burn amount
3. **Execution**: Tokens permanently destroyed
4. **Verification**: Supply reduction confirmed

**Economic Impact**:
- Deflationary pressure on MANA
- Supply reduction mechanism
- Value accrual to holders
- Transparent burning process
- Verifiable on blockchain

### Emergency Response System

**Purpose**: Rapid response to security incidents or system issues.

**Emergency Procedures**:

1. **Marketplace Pause**:
```solidity
// Immediate trading halt
marketplaceBurner.pause(marketplaceAddress);
```

2. **Fee Adjustment**:
```solidity
// Temporary fee reduction/increase
marketplaceBurner.setOwnerCutPerMillion(marketplace, newFee);
```

3. **Ownership Transfer**:
```solidity
// Transfer to secure multisig
marketplaceBurner.transferMarketplaceOwnership(marketplace, multisig);
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

**Owner-Only Functions**:
- All administrative functions restricted
- Single owner model for simplicity
- Consider multisig for production
- No delegation capabilities
- Clear ownership transfer

**Security Best Practices**:
1. Use multisig wallet as owner
2. Implement timelock for sensitive operations
3. Monitor all administrative actions
4. Regular security audits
5. Emergency response procedures

### Operational Security

**Safe Usage Guidelines**:

1. **Verify Targets**: Always confirm contract addresses
2. **Test First**: Use testnets for validation
3. **Double-Check Data**: Verify encoded function calls
4. **Monitor Events**: Track all executions
5. **Limit Exposure**: Minimize funds in burner

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Separate burner contracts for different purposes
- Regular owner key rotation
- Minimal ETH/token balances
- Audit trail maintenance
- Incident response plan

## Use Case Scenarios

### Token Recovery

**Scenario**: Tokens accidentally sent to wrong address

```solidity
// Recover ERC20 tokens
bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature(
    "transfer(address,uint256)",
    correctAddress,
    tokenAmount
);
burner.execute(tokenContract, 0, data);
```

### Contract Migration

**Scenario**: Upgrading to new contract version

```solidity
// 1. Pause old marketplace
marketplaceBurner.pause(oldMarketplace);

// 2. Transfer ownership to migration contract
marketplaceBurner.transferMarketplaceOwnership(
    oldMarketplace,
    migrationContract
);

// 3. Deploy and configure new marketplace
// 4. Destroy old contract if needed
nobody.die();
```

### Fee Adjustment

**Scenario**: Temporary promotional period

```solidity
// Reduce fees for promotion
marketplaceBurner.setOwnerCutPerMillion(
    marketplace,
    10000  // 1% instead of 2.5%
);

// Later restore normal fees
marketplaceBurner.setOwnerCutPerMillion(
    marketplace,
    25000  // Back to 2.5%
);
```

### Emergency Pause

**Scenario**: Security vulnerability discovered

```solidity
// Immediate pause
marketplaceBurner.pause(marketplace);

// Fix vulnerability
// Deploy patch
// Audit changes

// Resume operations
marketplaceBurner.unpause(marketplace);
```
